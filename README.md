cl-dispatch is a Common Lisp wrapper around [Grand Central Dispatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch) (aka [libdispatch](http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/)). It allows you to make lightweight queues and semaphores which allow the kernel to schedule your tasks across multiple cores.

It's not well documented yet, but the lisp API is in [cffi.lisp](http://github.com/sellout/cl-dispatch/blob/master/cffi.lisp), and there is also [Apple's documentation of the C API](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html).
